Matlab code for fringe processing. 

TPS_method - temporal phase shifting method using 3-, 4-, and 5-frame algorithm, then checking quality of the method using linear least squares regression of a surface to a plane.  Fourier_method - calculate phase of the fringes image + an example with seeing an image hidden in the phase and the amplitude using Fourier transformation
